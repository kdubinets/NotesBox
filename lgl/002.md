# How NOT to write a book (or blog)

Do not aim at writing a book, mentally aim at writing a *great*, *outstanding* book. The one that will stand out for the field.  
Reasons:
- Books are plenty
- Even mediocre book requires a lot of work. But reward from it is rather small:
  - Pay is around minimal wage;
  - Bragging rights / career effect are minimal;
  - Lifetime is few years;
  - You learn a lot, but the learning is rushed;

Aim to have knowledge for the great book first.  

Clear smaller challenges first:
- High reputation on Stack Exchange
  - Quick feedback loop
- Then succeed on your own blog
  - Prove that you have a "market": people that know you and trust/interested in what you say.
  - Hone you writing craft. [How exactly? Articles?]
- Make sure that you got ability to see beyond what people are talking in the area of your expertise
- Get to know right people, i.e. experts you can rely upon in you thinking.
- Make sure that you enjoy the process. If you don't love writing the book you readers aren't going to love in either.
