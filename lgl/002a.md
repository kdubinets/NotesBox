# Writing the book has a lot common with organizing the startup

1. Most books as well as startups fail.
1. Very few startups grow into  unicorns, and books become bestsellers. 
1. Publishers can be seen as venture capitalists, providing early financing, giving advice and guidance and taking away a lot of control.

This analogy brings following observations: 
1. Market proof is important for books too.
1. Solo vs coauthors is important decision. Currently it seems (based on the analogy with startups) to many books are written solo.
1. Early feedback is essential.
