### UPDATE:

If you liked this post, then you might be interested in my short course, [Evernote for Researchers: Collecting & Analyzing Online Data](https://www.udemy.com/evernote-for-researchers/). Though not zettelkasten in the pure sense, it is definitely inspired by zettelkasten and provides a solid overview of how to use Evernote as a research and analysis tool.
